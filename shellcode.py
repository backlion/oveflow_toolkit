"Put your EXPLOIT CODE HERE and it can be imported into the framework for future use."
"You will need to piece together the exploit code by reverse engineering known exploits such as msf or exploit-db."
"Once you have working exploit code you can reuse here, but do not forget to create a handler for the specific shellcode."
"This will help when you can not use metasploit."
"Examples to come"
