# oveflow_toolkit
A collection of tools to help research buffer overflow exploitation for the Offensive Security OSCP certification.

# Warning
I am not responsible for your actions, this code is to be used at your own risk and against systems you have permission to target.  This code does not contain shellcode, and all functioning exploit payloads will need to be crafted by the user.  I will put translation notes for exploits as I use them, but will not include shellcode.

# Example
sudo python2 attack_skeleton.py --rhost <target_ip> --rport 1434 --proto udp --exploit MS02_039

# Note
I am uploading this code to use as a reference during my OSCP lab and exam report. There may be bugs, I may not update, it just needs to be accessible to offensive security instructors to prove my work.
